# RANT
I am very satisfied with the code design this time (compared to before).

The main code design was finished very quicly, and each algorithm used (function and classes) could be implemented and tested individually. I had no confusing errors this time around.

The only problem is that the code is slow. It takes about 1h 30m for me to run the code on the input. But at least it works.
